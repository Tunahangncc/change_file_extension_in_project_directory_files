# Change File Extension

You started a project and worked on it for a long time, so there will be a lot of files in your file directory.

Let's say that the files you use in this crowded file directory;
         
- .html
- .js
- .css
- .scss
- vb.

You want to pull many files like this and replace the file extensions with another extension of your choice, but updating these files one by one can be very annoying.
